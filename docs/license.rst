``loggertodb`` was written by Antonis Christofides.  It is derived from
``autoupdate``, also written by Antonis Christofides, for the old openmeteo.org
database.  ``loggertodb`` is essentially ``autoupdate`` adapted to the hydria
database for the Odysseus project, and later to the Enhydris database.  This
version of ``loggertodb`` has nothing to do with versions older than 2005,
which were completely different, in a different programming language (Perl
rather than Python), and not based on ``autoupdate``.
